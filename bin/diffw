#
# USAGE

# __diffw__ [options...] _FILE1_ _FILE2_
#
# DESCRIPTION
# ===========
#
# From the project page: <http://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff>.
#
# The GNU __wdiff__ program is a front end to diff for comparing files on a word
# per word basis. A word is anything between whitespace. This is useful for
# comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed and for which
# paragraphs have been refilled. It works by creating two temporary files, one
# word per line, and then executes diff on these files. It collects the diff
# output and uses it to produce a nicer display of word differences between the
# original files.
#
# See the __wdiff__ man page for full details.
